# Rove-Project
Me and my team are developing this app to make life easier of daily commuters.

This app will be able to fetch the location of the bus driver i.e. inside the bus and that location will be sent to the user or the commuter through which the commuter can track the bus in real time, this is a project done for the college final year CSE.
